# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project

Newly graduate student (Bachelor's Degree in Finance), Steve, whose first clients are going to be his parents. Steve generated a data worksheet containing a variety of green energy stocks and will be looking into diversifying his parents investments. 

### Purpose

Steve has asked for assistance in analyzing the data on a variety of green energy stocks--he needs help in producing an analysis report for his parents utilizing VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to sift through and analyze the data file in a concise and efficient manner. The variables that will be explored are stock performances in 2017, as well as 2018.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Green Energy Stock Performance of 2017 and 2018

The data suggests that green energy stock performance did significantly well in 2017 in comparison to 2018. More specifically, in comparsion of Total Daily Volumes for DQ Ticker between 2017 and 2018---displayed that DQ stocks were significantly traded in 2018, but did not do well in terms on Return on Investments. In my opinion, that observation might be correlated to the economy and the Presidential Administration at that time. 

Below are two screen captures of stock performance tables from 2017 and 2018.

In addition, two screen captures of the Refactored VBA Code is displayed to reveal what specific macros code was utilized in the final iteration of tables.

### Execution times of the Original Script and the Refactored Script

Here are two screen captures of the original execution times, followed by the next two screen captures of the refactored execution times.

These are the refactored execution times.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The challenging part of this module is getting used to the language/ syntax setup--coming from a background with zero experience to this extent, it was daunting to read all this, and forcing my brain to remember why certain actions have to be taken in order for particular codes to run smoothly. 

## Summary

- What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantages of refactoring code is that it is much easier to sift through and correct as oppose to starting all over. However, the disadvantages of refactoring code is that it gets a bit tricky and strains the eyes to visualize the codes because it is basically a copy and paste technique with making some adjustments as you go through. One thing I learned is that google really is your best friend in completing the challenges. 

- How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The pros and cons of refactoring apply to this challenge because there was easy parts and difficult parts to sift through the code and the previous modules, along with the use of google to search up codes/ assistance. Reading through the inital macros we created throughout the exercise, really helped me adjust the new refactored VBA codes.
