# VBA of Wall Street

## Overview of Project
Newly graduate student (Bachelor's Degree in Finance), Steve, whose first clients are going to be his parents. Steve generated a data worksheet containing a variety of green energy stocks and will be looking into diversifying his parents investments. 

### Purpose
Steve has asked for assistance in analyzing the data on a variety of green energy stocks--he needs help in producing an analysis report for his parents utilizing VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to sift through and analyze the data file in a concise and efficient manner. The variables that will be explored are stock performances in 2017, as well as 2018.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Green Energy Stock Performance of 2017 and 2018
The data suggests that green energy stock performance did significantly well in 2017 in comparison to 2018. More specifically, in comparsion of Total Daily Volumes for DQ Ticker between 2017 and 2018---displayed that DQ stocks were significantly traded in 2018, but did not do well in terms on Return on Investments. In my opinion, that observation might be correlated to the economy and the Presidential Administration at that time. 

Below are two screen captures of stock performance tables from 2017 and 2018.

In addition, two screen captures of the Refactored VBA Code is displayed to reveal what specific macros code was utilized in the final iteration of tables.
